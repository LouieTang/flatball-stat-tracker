# flatball-stat-tracker
MERN Fullstack Web Application Project.

## description
This is a stat tracker for flatball - more popularly known as ultimate frisbee. This project started with inspiration from www.ultianalytics.com, the main source of analytics for ultimate frisbee currently; however this summer I decided there were features that I wanted that were not available within the application. Hence, this project was my solution. This project was started on October 5th, 2023 and is an ongoing project set to be working on a small scale as soon as the end of November, 2023.

## acknowledgements
I would like to thank www.ultianalytics.com for providing inspiration for this project, a lot of this project is an attempt to mimic their functionality, as well as implement some of my own new functionality that is suited towards where and how I would use this application.

I would also like to cite and thank the following youtube videos for their help with making this project possible:
